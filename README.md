# MACPCS: Multi-Race Ant Colony Parallel Chaos Algorithm

This project is an implementation and enhancement of **MACPCS** — the **Multi-Race Ant Colony Parallel Chaos Algorithm**, inspired by a published research paper on swarm intelligence and constraint optimization. It includes both a faithful reproduction of the original algorithm and an improved version optimized for performance and memory handling.

---

## 🧾 Project Structure

- **`MACPCS_paperalgo.ipynb`** – Jupyter notebook implementing the original MACPCS algorithm as described in the research literature.
- **`MACPCS_improved.ipynb`** – Enhanced version of MACPCS with optimizations in chaos function handling, race dynamics, memory utilization, and ant path convergence.

## 🧠 Features

- Multi-race ant colony simulation with chaotic search dynamics
- Parallel exploration using chaos-based parameter tuning
- Performance optimization for improved convergence and solution quality
- Visualizations of algorithm behavior across iterations
- Comparative study between original and improved versions

## ⚙️ Algorithm Overview

MACPCS combines:

- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Metaheuristic inspired by real-world ant behavior.
- **Multi-Race Strategy**: Parallel ant colonies with diverse characteristics.
- **Chaos Theory**: Chaotic maps introduce randomness to escape local optima.

The **improved version** refines:

- Race coordination strategies  
- Chaos-based path update rules  
- Resource-aware performance tuning

---

## 📈 Performance Comparison

Both versions can be benchmarked on:

- Convergence speed  
- Optimality of solutions  
- Computational time  
- Memory usage  

Plots and logs are embedded in the notebooks for detailed insights.
